        the federal government mostly assists in curriculum development, accreditation and in the financing of research

        quality education to children of the age group 5 to 16 years. "The State shall provide free and compulsory
        education to all children of the age of five to sixteen years in such a manner as may be determined by law".[3]

        Most of Master's degree programs require two years education. Master of Philosophy (MPhil) is available in most
        of the subjects and can be undertaken after doing Masters. Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) education is available in
        selected areas and is usually pursued after earning a MPhil degree. Students pursuing MPhil or PhD degrees must
